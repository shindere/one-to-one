Tentative rules for the 1:1 repositories

In each repository, the meeting agenda is maintained in the next.md file.

At each meeting we create a dedicated file where we store notes on what
has been discussed during that meeting and update the next.md file so
that it always contains the list of topics we want to discuss and did not
manage to discuss so far.

Each element to discuss is added as a title (starting with ##) and
begins with the name of the person who added the item to the agenda
